# CECS-326 Project 2
Group: Reichen Brown (ID: 029657509) & Claudia Rawson (ID: 030782685)

## SUMMARY
The project files contain a Makefile that will compile the code and provide a run function.

To begin, the director should contain the following files:

    1. main.c
    2. Makefile

Commands provided by the Makefile:

    1. make
    2. make run
    3. make clean

## HOW TO RUN
**Command: make**

    To compile the code, use the "make" command in the terminal by typing: make
        This will generate the executable file, dining_philosopher.
    
**Command: make run**

    Use the "run" command in the terminal by typing: make run
        This should begin the Dining Philosopher Loop.

**Command: make clean**

    For more tests, you can remove the output files using "make clean"
        This should clean up your directory from previous test outputs.
